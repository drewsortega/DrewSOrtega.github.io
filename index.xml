I&amp;rsquo;m Drew. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a 4th year undergraduate student at Oregon State University, where I study computer science with a minor in mathematics.
I grew up in Tigard, OR and attended Tigard High School, which fostered my interests in technology for years to come. My teacher at the time, Steve Fulton, provided opportinuities to learn robotics, take programming classes, and earn modern industry-level IT certificates.
In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking, and backpacking throughout Oregon and Washington.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://drewsortega.github.io/portfolio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drewsortega.github.io/portfolio/</guid><description>Projects ORTSOC Infrastructure (Senior Capstone) Designed a Security Operations Center (SOC) Infrastructure for data ingestion and analysis of client security events Wrote Ansible Playbooks with YAML and Jinja2 Templating Engine to standardize and automate deployment and updates Set up hardware running several drives and blades running within the Oregon State University Network, with its own firewall, pfsense, and VMWare Instance.
